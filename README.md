# Ghostty configuration

```bash
stow -t "$HOME" ghostty
```

Then reload the Ghostty config (cmd+shift+,)

# Neovim configuration

This config has been heavily inspired by the [kickstart project](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim), but it
isn't a fork per say. I wanted to write the config myself and make sure I understand (almost) every piece of code / config
my neovim setup uses. Plus, I did want to make sure the config isn't bloated with stuff and keymaps and settings I'm not
gonna be using.

The kickstart config commit : 3338d39. If anything breaks in the future (maybe due to a neovim update or a plugin update),
take a look at the kickstart github and see if maybe they addressed it.

## Installation

(Eventually) backup the current config :

~~~bash
mv ${HOME}/.config/nvim ${HOME}/.config/nvim.bak
mv ${HOME}/.local/share/nvim ${HOME}/.local/share/nvim.bak
mv ${HOME}/.local/state/nvim ${HOME}/.local/state/nvim.bak
mv ${HOME}/.cache/nvim ${HOME}/.cache/nvim.bak
~~~

Install this config :

~~~bash
stow -t "$HOME" nvim
~~~

Install dependencies :

~~~bash
# ripgrep is required for telescopes's grepping features
brew install ripgrep
~~~

## Alias vi to nvim

```bash
cat >/etc/profile.d/vi.sh <<EOF
alias vi=nvim
EOF
```

# Scripts set up

```bash
stow -t "/usr/local/bin/" scripts
```

# Tmux configuration

```bash
stow -t "$HOME" tmux
```

When running `tmux` for the first time after that, the config will try
and bootstrap `tpm` by cloning it then installing all plugins configured. So,
the first execution of tmux might take a while.

The tmux config may include binding to execute scripts installed in `$HOME/.config/scripts`.
So make sure these are set up correctly.

# Git configuration

~~~bash
stow -t "$HOME" git
git config --global core.excludesFile "${HOME}/.config/git/.gitignore"
~~~

# profile.d configuration

```bash
sudo stow -t /etc/profile.d profile.d
```

# Keyboard configuration

~~~bash
sudo stow -t "${HOME}/Library/LaunchAgents" keyboard
launchctl load "${HOME}/Library/LaunchAgents/$(ls keyboard)"
~~~

# PS1

Just add the content of `bash/PS1.sh` somewhere in the `/etc/bashrc` file.

# .inputrc

```bash
stow -t "$HOME" inputrc
```
